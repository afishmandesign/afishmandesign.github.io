                UT has a well-established brand that sought crystallization on their university brand. 
                A full review sought clarity to their elevator speech. At the same time, they sought to 
                expand its visual palette while maintaining integrity with their existing brand assets. 
                Two brand concept directions and messaging were showed. The big idea built on the historic UT Tennessee Volunteer Spirit. 
                Two rounds of creative ideation and two full days of brainstorm Jamboard critique and then developing an animatronic via 
                Powerpoint and Premier Pro with voice-over, sound and use of archived stills geared toward general brand awareness and the undergraduate market.
